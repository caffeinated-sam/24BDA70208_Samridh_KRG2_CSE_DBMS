## AIM: 
To understand and implement SQL SELECT queries using various clauses such as WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently from relational database tables.

## Software Requirements
### ●	Database Management System:

#### ○	PostgreSQL

### ●	Database Administration Tool:

#### ○	pgAdmin

## Objective :
  ●	To practice writing SQL SELECT statements.

  ●	To apply filtering conditions using the WHERE clause.

  ●	To sort query results using the ORDER BY clause.

  ●	To group records using the GROUP BY clause.

  ●	To filter grouped data using the HAVING clause.

  ●	To analyze data using aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().


## Actual Implementation Steps / Logic / Tasks Performed

#### Table Setup
- Created a table named **Students** to store student information.
- The table contains the following fields:
  - **id**: Unique student ID (Primary Key)
  - **name**: Student name
  - **city**: City of the student
  - **marks**: Marks obtained by the student

#### Data Insertion
- Inserted multiple student records into the **Students** table.
- Each record includes values for `id`, `name`, `city`, and `marks`.

#### City-wise Student Count
- Counted the number of students in each city using the **COUNT()** function.
- Grouping was performed using **GROUP BY city** so each city gets its own count.
- Both methods were used:
  - `COUNT(*)` to count total rows
  - `COUNT(id)` to count non-null IDs (same result here since ID is always present)

#### Sorting Based on Count
- Sorted the cities based on the number of students in each city.
- Used **ORDER BY** to arrange the results in ascending order.

#### Filtering Cities with Minimum Students
- Identified cities having at least **3 students**.
- Used the **HAVING** clause because it filters results after grouping.

#### Average Marks per City
- Calculated the average marks for each city using **AVG(marks)**.
- Used **GROUP BY city** to calculate separate averages for each city.
- Displayed average marks with precision up to **2 decimal places**.

## Procedure of the Practical (Step-by-Step)

1. Open the SQL environment (such as PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) and connect to the required database.

2. Create a table named **Students** with columns for:
   - Student ID
   - Student Name
   - City
   - Marks  
   Also set the **id** column as the Primary Key.

3. Insert the given student records into the **Students** table by providing values for each column.

4. Execute a query to count the number of students in each city using **COUNT()** along with **GROUP BY city**.

5. Execute a query to sort the city-wise student count results using **ORDER BY** (ascending order).

6. Execute a query to find cities having at least **3 students** using **HAVING COUNT() >= 3**.

7. Execute a query to calculate the average marks of students in each city using **AVG(marks)** and group the results using **GROUP BY city**.
